MusicBrainz data set
====================

For the basis of our benchmarks we use the list of artists known to MusicBrinz.
We are currently using the dump `20150321-002747`.
Having downloaded the latest mbdump.tar.bz2, you can use the script `extract-from-dbdump.py` to get a file for which we assume the name `artists.txt`.
